To get some info about 
Cyberdeck 
the CCG (collectible Card Game)
the OG (the Online Game)
the SG (StandAlone Game)
the WB (The WebGame )
the MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game)

see http://lab.dyne.org/CyberDeck


Just a couple of Ideas.

First... the server

We can use mysql for status maintenance or file based DB (just a change in DB.pm).
For each user we have to mantain

(general purpose data)
--------------------
(real world related)
ID
username
password
realname
email
country
(all sort of stupid personal info we want)

--------------------
(avatar-related)
avatar-sex
avatar-faction (preferred faction or color for magic or type for pokemon)
avatar-image
avatar-description
avatar-age
avatar-type

--------------------
(session-related)
session
lastseen

--------------------
(collection-related)
uID (unique ID for user)
cID (card ID)

--------------------
(deck-related)
ID (you can have multiple decks)
name (a name for the deck)
type (if it's a special type deck  here is the place, for special i mean with some costraint, 1 color/faction, double colour, unlimited, only common etc etc) This check can be done realtime if we want instead of storing it here, but when you build a deck we can give a response on the type fitting the deck and store them here instead of check things everytime
cards (id of the cards in the deck)

--------------------
(stats-related)
login-number
creation-date
match-number
match-won
match-draw
resign
win-by-resign

We should also provide a system to have some other entries related to the game (Magic will have some other entry than cyberdeck). Those are just the base for every game.

cards can be saved in a csv or an xml

Then we have to create a GameRoom where user can place a table to game (or invite someone or create a multiplayer match or a tournament)

Game
--------------------
ID
num_player          (magic and cyberdeck and pokemon can have a game with more than 2 players, cyberdeck can have also a solo-game, attacking a network pre-built)
type                (king, 5 colour, 2 vs 2 or whatever we want, the contraint about this should be saved in some xml or in db if we want, ex: 5colour need a deck with only 1 colour, or 1 faction or some system to check restriction)
joined_player       (id of players already joined, the order can change once the game start, this order will be the turn order too)
date                (date in which the game was placed in the room)
expire-date         (if exist)
start-date          (date the game stared)
player-turn         (id of the next turn player)
turn                (turn number)
phase               (phase of the turn, upkeep, draw etc etc) (i presume a simple tinyint or enum is enough)
intreq              (request of intervention from non-in-turn player, this is needed for smartcard intervention, or interrupt or fasteffect, can be a number that decrease until reach 0 that means all user give a response, in case a fasteffect is played the number return to num_player-1 to permit to use a fasteffect against the fasteffect played).
